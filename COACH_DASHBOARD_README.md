## Database Requirements

The implementation uses the existing `coaches` table with the following columns:
- `id`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `gender`
- `user_id` (foreign key to users table)
- `sport_id` (foreign key to sports table)
- `photo`
- `bio`
- `socail_links` (JSON)
- `city`
- `country_id`
- `age`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

The `users` table should have:
- `coach_id` column for linking users to coach profiles
- Role system via `role_user` pivot table

## How to Use

### 1. Creating a Coach User

To test the coach dashboard, you need a user with the 'coach' role:

```php
// In Laravel Tinker or a seeder
$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'coach@example.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('password'),
]);

$user->assignRole('coach');
```

### 2. First Login

When a coach logs in for the first time:
1. They are redirected to `/coach/setup`
2. They fill in their profile information (name, sport, etc.)
3. After submission, they are redirected to the coach dashboard

### 3. Dashboard Features

Once set up, coaches can:
- View their teams and players
- Track scheduled and completed matches
- Monitor injury reports and transfers
- Access quick actions for common tasks
- View and manage calendar events
- Chat with players and other coaches
- Check tournament information
- View season statistics

### 4. Profile Management

Coaches can update their profile at any time:
1. Click "Settings" in the sidebar
2. Update their information
3. Upload a profile photo
4. Save changes
